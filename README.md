# LOST (Lord of the Strings) Coding Helper

A simplified LeetCode-style app for practicing coding problems, tracking progress, and interacting with solutions. Built for **CSCE 247-002 – Software Engineering**.

The goal was to design and model a structured software system using object-oriented principles and design patterns from the course.

## Design & architecture

The system is modeled in UML with core classes such as **User**, **Question**, **Solution**, **Comment**, and **ProgressTracker**. A **Facade** (`ProblemApplication`) coordinates the main functionality.

Concepts we focused on:

- Object-oriented design
- Separation of concerns
- Facade design pattern
- UML modeling
- System architecture planning

LOST is meant to be a lightweight coding-practice platform that demonstrates clear software design and organization.

## Data persistence (JSON)

Data is consolidated into two files, aligned with the UML and **DataLoader** / **DataWriter** channels:

- **`json/users.json`** – User accounts, achievement definitions, progress trackers, and leaderboard. In each user, `achievements` and `progressTracker` are stored as reference IDs (`achievementIds`, `progressTrackerId`); `favoriteProblems` remains a list of question IDs.
- **`json/questions.json`** – All questions with their solutions, comments, and attachments embedded, plus supported languages. One load provides full question data for the app.
